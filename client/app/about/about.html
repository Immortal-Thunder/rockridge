      <h1 class="margin-top-lg">Mission</h1>
      <p class="margin-bottom-sm">
        Rockridge is an open source software project that
        aims to demystify the process of building a personal financial plan.<br>
        We aim to empower users to take control of their financial futures and
        educate them along the way.
      </p>

      <h1 class="margin-top-lg">Details</h1>
      <p class="margin-bottom-sm">
        Rockridge is a simple, clean, and intuitive web application that prompts
        the user to input all the neccessary information needed to build a plan.<br>
        After the information is entered, complex calculations are done behind the scenes
        to create the best plan for that particular user. <br> These calculations are based on years
        of combined experience and research of our team, and are reliable and accurate.*

        Why did we create Rockridge? We saw first hand how broken the personal financial advising
        industry is. <br> Many individuals are weary of financial advisors - and for good reason.
        <br> Rockridge is a safe, zero pressure environment guides a user along the path to
        financial freedom and independence. <br>Whether you are trying to pay down debt, save for
        retirement, analyse your personal risk, <br> or just understand your financial situation better
        - Rockridge can help you achieve your financial goals. <br> Rockridge doesn't cost you
        anything, but it can save you a lifetime of worry and stress.
